# sm3.py

Implemented SM3 algorithm.

# SM3_rho_attack.py

It cost 250.9613482952118s to find a collision of highest 16-bit. Once spent ten hours trying to find a collision of highest 32-bit, but failed.

# for_optimize.h & sm3_opti.cpp

Implemented optimization of SM3 algorithm. The speed-up ratio can go up to about ten times.
